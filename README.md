# Welcome to the Zesty Lion Clothing Store!

The best clothing store known to man! I attempted to implement all requirements as laid out by the specs.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

1. You will need node package manager to install the dependencies.

2. You will need the angular cli to get this package to work.


## Instructions

1. Git Clone this repo
2. cd Zesty-Lion-Clothing/
3. npm install
4. ng serve -o

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Given more time I would

* Add more comments so that developers from our team would better understand the code.
* Fix any user interactions with the cart
* Add better support for screen readers for those with visual impairments
